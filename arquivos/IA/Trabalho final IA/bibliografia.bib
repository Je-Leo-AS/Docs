	abstract = {Agriculture plays a pivotal role in sustaining global food security and addressing the challenges of a growing population. However, the efficient use of water and nutrients in agriculture is crucial to mitigate environmental impact while maximizing crop yield. In recent years, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into agricultural practices has gained momentum, offering innovative solutions for optimizing irrigation and nutrient management. This review paper examines the diverse applications of AI in agriculture, focusing on its role in enhancing irrigation scheduling and nutrient management for improved productivity and resource conservation. The paper presents an overview of various AI technologies, such as machine learning, remote sensing, and data analytics, and their contributions to sustainable agricultural practices. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with the adoption of AI in agriculture, including data quality, model interpretability, and farmer acceptance. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent research and case studies, this review underscores the potential of AI to revolutionize irrigation and nutrient management strategies, ultimately fostering a more resilient and productive agricultural sector.},

Com isso se faz importante o uso de tecnologias, como a aplicação do Processamento Digital de Imagens, que permite tratar as imagens coletadas e aperfeiçoá-las para a interpretação humana e, em seguida, a análise automática pelo computador, a partir da classificação do reconhecimento de padrões. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi testar métodos de Machine Learning para estimar a distribuição das plantas na linha de plantio da lavoura de soja. O modelo Random Forest apresentou melhor resultado com acurácia em torno de 65% em média, porém o algoritmo não obteve um resultado considerado satisfatório. É possível concluir que a dificuldade de classificação das distâncias entre plantas de soja com o modelo utilizado pode estar associada às variáveis qualidade de imagem, sobreposição das plantas de soja e a precisão do modelo.   Palavras-chave: Aeronave remotamente pilotada; Agricultura de precisão; Inteligência Artificial; Visão Computacional.   MACHINE LEARNING AND DIGITAL UAV IMAGE PROCESSING: AN APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE LONGITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOYBEAN PLANTS   ABSTRACT: It is possible to achieve high productivity in soybean crops, by sowing with adequate and uniform local distribution of the seeds.  To attain this, the use of technologies is important - for example the application of Digital Image Processing that allows treatment of collected images and improvement for human interpretation, and then the automatic analysis by the computer, based on pattern recognition classification. The objective of this research was to test Machine Learning methods to estimate the distribution of plants in the soybean planting line. The Random Forest model showed the best result, where the resulting accuracy was 65% on average, but the algorithm did not obtain a good result. It is possible to conclude that the difficulty of classifying the distances between soybean plants with the model used may be associated with the variables of image quality, overlapping of soybean plants and the precision of the model.   Keywords: Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Precision agriculture; Remotely piloted aircraft.},

	abstract = {The world population is expected to grow by another two billion in 2050, according to the survey taken by the Food and Agriculture Organization, while the arable area is likely to grow only by 5%. Therefore, smart and efficient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential tools for agriculture development. Several new technologies and innovations are being implemented in agriculture as an alternative to collect and process farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor networks has triggered the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain of agriculture. This research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor networks with Artificial Intelligence systems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture land suitability. This proposed system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for cultivation in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input collected from the various sensor devices, which are used for training the system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden layers is found to be effective for the multiclass classification system when compared to the other existing model. This trained model will be used for evaluating future assessments and classifying the land after every cultivation.},

@article{Redmon2015,
	abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},
